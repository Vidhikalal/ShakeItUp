# 🎧 VYBE — Feel the Music

VYBE is an accessibility-first music experience designed for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community.  
Instead of *hearing* music, users **feel it through intelligent vibration patterns**, allowing them to connect with rhythm, beats, and emotion in a completely new way.

Music isn’t just sound — it’s movement, energy, and feeling.  
VYBE makes sure everyone gets to experience it.

## ✨ What VYBE Does

- 🎶 Converts music and audio signals into **real-time vibration patterns**
- 📳 Uses **haptic feedback** to represent beats, bass, tempo, and intensity
- 🤖 Leverages **AI (Gemini)** to analyze audio features and map them to meaningful vibrations
- ⚡ Streams data in real time using **WebSockets** for low-latency feedback
- ♿ Built with accessibility and inclusivity at the core

## 🧠 How It Works (High Level)

1. **Audio Input**  
   Music is analyzed for tempo, amplitude, frequency, and rhythm.

2. **AI Analysis (Gemini)**  
   Gemini processes the audio features and determines vibration patterns that best represent the music.

3. **Real-Time Communication**  
   Vibration data is streamed using WebSockets for instant feedback.

4. **Haptic Output (iOS)**  
   The iOS app translates the data into vibrations users can physically feel.

## 💙 Why VYBE Matters

Millions of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals are excluded from music-centric experiences.  
VYBE reimagines what it means to “listen” — turning sound into something **felt, shared, and inclusive**.
